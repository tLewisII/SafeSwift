## SafeSwift, because "subscripting considered harmful".

SafeSwift is a library of safe functions that replace some standard Swift functions and features, like Array subscripting and forced unwrapping of Optional types, with safe versions that __will not__ crash your app at runtime.

## Functions and Types
Array Type Signatures

```swift
func safeIndex(i:Int) -> T?
func safeHead() -> T?
func safeTail() -> T[]?
func safeRange(r:Array<Range<Int>>) -> T[]?
```
Optional Type Signatures

```swift
func safeUnwrap<T>(op:Optional<T>, defaultVal:T) -> T
```

Other stuff will probably be added when I find it. Pull requests and issues welcome.
